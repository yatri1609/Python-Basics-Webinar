# Introduction to Python workshop

This repository contains materials for the introductory Python webianr at CUIP.

### 1. Software for the workshop

The best learning experience happens when you can edit and run code. So, please have Python Anaconda, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and Jupyter installed before the start of the workshop. Follow the steps below to setup your environment: 

1. [Click here to download Python Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Scroll down to the "Anaconda Installers" section and click the "Graphical Installer" option that corresponds to your operating system. 

2. If you are using Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (PC), you can pip install the necessary packages by typing: 

`$ pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter`

> Windows users only - if you wish to emulate the Bash programming language found in Mac users' "Terminal" application, [click here to download GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a Unix command-line environment for Windows users. 

Alternatively, you can install these packages by adding a cell to the top of your Jupyter Notebook and typing: 

`!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter`

### 2. Files for the workshop

Once the software is installed, download the necessary files for the workshops which are contained in this repository. Get them by doing the following:

1. Click the green "Clone or Download" button
2. Click "Download Zip"
3. Extract this .zip file someplace familiar, such as your Desktop. 

Or, you can also clone this repository using git.

### 3. Open a Jupyter Notebook

Open the "Anaconda Navigator" application and click "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook (for Windows)

OR

Open Terminal and type `conda activate` (For Linux)

or

Navigate to the respository using Terminal or Gitbash and type

`$ cd introduction-to-pandas`

then

`$ jupyter notebook` or `python3 -m notebook`

This will open a blank notebook for you to use as a scratch space is you desire. Open the different jupyter notebooks to access the tutorial.

### 4. Outline

For this workshop, we'll go through pandas, numpy, and matplotlib packages of python. Please make sure you go through the initial-python-tutorial.pynb file and make yourself familiar with most of the python syntax.
